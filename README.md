# libBasicSOFA

A very basic library for reading Spatially Oriented Format for Acoustics (SOFA) files, a format for storing HRTFs and/or BRIRs for binuaral audio reproduction.  
More information on this format can be found in the [SOFA Conventions](https://www.sofaconventions.org/mediawiki/index.php/SOFA_(Spatially_Oriented_Format_for_Acoustics)) website or in the AES standard document, AES69-2015.  For those looking for a more comprehensive library, check out [libMySofa](https://github.com/hoene/libmysofa)


## Library Constraints
### Listeners and Sources
The SOFA specification allows for multiple sound sources and listeners.  A listener can have multiple view vectors (orientation of head).  However, this library only supports one view vector.  A head rotation should be reflected only by the data in ListenerPosition.  Alternatively, multiple sources surrounding the head are reflected by the data in SourcePosition.


### Coordinates
Only spherical coordinates are supported in this library.  **Cartesian coordinates are NOT supported**


## Conventions

The following chart outlines the spherical coordinate system used in the SOFA specification.

## Building
### Dependencies
libBasicSOFA depends on the [HDF5 API](https://www.hdfgroup.org).  MacOS users can obtain this API through Homebrew:
```shell
brew install hdf5
```


### Build Instructions
A CMake file is in the works.  In the meantime, to build on MacOS, create a new library project, add the libBasicSOFA source files and build.


## Using the Library
The following code snippet demonstrates instantiating a libBasicSOFA object, reading a SOFA file, getting some properties and finally getting an impulse response for a given channel and spherical coordinate (theta, phi, radius):


```c++
BasicSOFA::BasicSOFA sofa;

bool success = sofa.readSofaFile("/path/to/sofa/file.sofa");
if (!success)
    return;
    
auto samplingFrequency = sofa.getFs();
auto numSourcePositions = sofa.getM();

auto theta = 150.0;
auto phi = 0.0;
auto radius = 1.0;
auto channel = 0;

const double *impulseResp = sofa.getHRIR(channel, theta, phi, radius);
if (impulseResp == nullptr)
    return;
```
